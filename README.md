# rs-vlc-model
This repository containts a Python code to simulate a basic model of VLC communication using a rolling shutter mode in non-line-of-sight link.

## Description of the project
Optical Camera COmmunications OCC refers to the use of e image sensors to transmit information wirelessly. Rolling Shutter is an acquisition mechanism implemented by image sensors to generate an image. Using the rolling shutter mechanism, high-frequency signals can be detected in three differents color channels (RGB). Some indoor applications can be implemented using a reflectance surface. The users receive the information by capturing light from a reflecting surface with a smartphone camera. Figure depicts this type of application. Besides, Wavelength Division Multiplexing techniques such as Color Shift Keying modulation increase the data rate of the Optical Camera Communication systems. The simulation of rolling shutter-OCC using a Color Shift Keying is addressed in this project.
