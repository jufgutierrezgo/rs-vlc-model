# rs-vlc-model
This repository containts a Python code to simulate a basic model of VLC communication using a rolling shutter mode in non-line-of-sight link.

## Description of the system
Optical Camera COmmunications refers to the use of the image sensor to capture light signals to transmit information wirelessly. Rolling Shutter is an acquisition mechanism implemented by image sensors to generate an image. Using the rolling shutter mechanism, high-frequency signals can be detected in three differents color channels (RGB).
